# ATM-Project

About Me
Hello! My name is Haseeb Asif, and I'm a first-semester student pursuing Computer Science at Fast Nuces Karachi. This repository contains my project work for the semester, specifically an ATM Management System implemented in the C programming language.

Project Overview
This project aims to simulate the basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). The system allows users to perform various banking operations such as withdrawing cash, depositing funds, checking balance, and transferring money between accounts. It's a command-line-based program designed to provide a user-friendly interface for customers to interact with.

Motivation
The motivation behind developing this ATM Management System project is to apply the theoretical knowledge gained in my first semester of studying computer science to a real-world scenario. Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) are integral to modern banking systems, providing customers with convenient access to their funds and banking services. By building this system, I aim to deepen my understanding of programming concepts such as data structures, file handling, and user input/output in the context of a practical application.

Features
1. User Authentication:
The system prompts users to enter their account number and PIN for authentication purposes.
Implements basic security measures to ensure the confidentiality of user information.
2. Account Management:
Allows users to check their account balance.
Supports depositing funds into the account.
Enables users to withdraw cash from their account.
Facilitates transferring money between accounts.
3. Transaction History:
Records all transactions performed by users.
Provides a transaction history feature, allowing users to view their recent transactions.
4. Error Handling:
Incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to deal with invalid inputs and edge cases.
Displays informative error messages to guide users in case of errors.


Technologies Used
Programming Language: C
Development Environment: Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or any other C IDE/Editor
Version Control: Git, GitHub
Documentation: Markdown format for README.md and contributing.md files
Build Tools: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for compiling the C code
